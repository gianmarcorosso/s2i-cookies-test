Code Implementations

#Function getCookie:
- Replaced the use of forEach with a traditional for loop to make the code more readable and compact.
This change was motivated by the desire to find the desired cookie in a more direct and immediate manner.

#Function setUtmCookie:
- Added a referrer parameter, which captures the user's referring URL.
  > This addition enhances the functionality by providing information about the source of the user.
- Modified the structure of cValue to include referrer as part of the object.
  > This ensures that the referring URL is included in the data being stored.
- Changed how multiple cookies are handled.
  > Now, if there is already information in the utm_parameters cookie, the new landing data is appended to the existing information instead of overwriting it.
    This allows for the capture of additional information, such as the user's referrer.
